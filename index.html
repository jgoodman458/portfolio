				<h3>Additional Projects</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I have built many rockets using many different types of fuels including hair spray, sugar, alcohol vapors, water and air pressure as well as conventional model rocket engines. The water rocket was about two feet tall and was made from several two liter soda bottles. The rocket used an accelerorameter and arduino to detect its apex and deploy a parachute.</li>
					<li>I designed and 3D printed a putter head that better fit my eye. I designed the putter head with additional curves and a better alignment system.</li>
					<li>I designed a speaker driver that used a ferrofluid as a lubricant to reduce unwanted vibration as the speaker oscillated.</li>
