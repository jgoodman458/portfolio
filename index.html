				<h3>Founder and Project Lead, AeroBing Rocketry Research Group: Ambition-III Rocket Project</h3>
				<div id="intro-aerobing">
					<p>
						The AeroBing Ambition-III Rocket Project was founded in the Winter of 2019 and aims to send a student-built rocket past the Karman Line. Ambition-III is currently under developement with a planned launch date in the Summer of 2021.
						<ul>
							<li>Lead a 15-member team planning to launch a rocket into space</li>
							<li>AeroBing Awarded a $2500 grant for the Analytical and Diagnostics Laboratory at Binghamton University</li>
							<li>Led the development of the following selected simulations: a stage-mass optimization program (MATLAB), a robust trajectory optimization software capable of solving the Goddard Problem (MATLAB), a 6 degrees of freedom trajectory simulation software (MATLAB), multiple transient thermal analyses (MATLAB), a 3D aerodynamic simulation (ANSYS Fluent), a transient nozzle flow simulation (ANSYS Fluent), a shock-free nozzle contour design tool using the method of characteristics (MATLAB), a rocket trilateration script using nonlinear optimization (MATLAB), an aerodynamic heating calculation script (MATLAB), and a thermal-structural analysis of the rocket during the burn phase (ANSYS Thermal and ANSYS Mechanical). To compliment the trajectory simulation software, a Monte Carlo program and statistical analysis tool was also developed to accurately predict where the rocket will land.</li>

				<h3>Additional Projects</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Rocketry: </strong>Constructed various rockets using many different types of fuels including hair spray, alcohol vapors, water and air pressure as well as conventional model rocket engines. The water rocket was about two feet tall and was made from several two liter soda bottles. The water rocket used a G-force sensor and Arduino microcontroller to detect its apogee and deploy a parachute.</li>
					<li><strong>COVID-19 Prototype Ventilator: </strong>Designed and constructed a low-cost ventilator prototype in my dorm room using parts found in Walmart. The project was covered by The Chronicle of Higher Education, NewsChannel 34, WBNG, FOX 40/WICZ-TV, and Spectrum News, with an estimated circulation of 3.1 million (Source: Binghamton University Office of Communications and Marketing).</li>
					<li><strong>Design and Analysis of a Landing Gear Mechanism: </strong>Utilized PTC Creo Parametric and Mechanism to design and simulate a landing gear mechanism. Performed kinematic and dynamic analyses in Creo. Scripted ANSYS APDL to analyze the stress distribution in the pins and perform convergence analysis.</li>
					<li><strong>Golf Putter Head: </strong>Designed and 3D printed a putter head that better fit my eye. The putter head was carefully designed with additional curves and a better alignment system.</li>
					<li><strong>Ferrofluid Audio Speaker: </strong>Designed an audio speaker that used ferrofluid as a lubricant to reduce vibrational noise due to friction as the magnet oscillated.</li>
					<li><strong>3-Stage Coil Gun: </strong>Built a three stage coil gun. Designed a gate sensor to fire each coil stage only when the projectile was a certain distance from the coil stage. This allowed for each coil stage to fire in rapid succession based on the position of the projectile in the barrel rather than a predetermined time delay. This increased the effectiveness of each stage. The coilgun used wire bobbins that were 3D printed to allow for easy wrapping of the magnet wire.</li>
					<li><strong>High Voltage Experiments: </strong>Built two high voltage power supplies using flyback transformers from old television sets. Then used the power supplies to power high voltage demos such as Jacob's ladder and ion-lifters. Was able to power the CO2 laser (from above) with one of them.</li>
					<li><strong>Aluminum Foundry: </strong>Contructed an aluminum foundry using play sand and a plaster of Paris refractory material. A hair dryer forced hot air into the bottom of the foundry. The foundry was able to completely melt aluminum cans and heat steel until it was red hot and malleable.</li>
					<li><strong>Reaction Time Arcade Game: </strong>Designed and constructed a reaction time arcade game as part of a team. The game utilized a 3D printed infrared blaster device that was to be drawn and fired by the player in minimal time. The game was programmed using an Arduino microcontroller and included a game mode that allowed the player to duel against a computer simulated player that increased in difficulty. The longer the player lasted against the computer, the higher the player's score.</li>
					<li><strong>Reverse Engineering Project: </strong>Disassembled an Oster vegetable steamer and identified every single part. Siemens Solid Edge was utlized to model every part, create dimensional drawings, and render photorealistic images of the assembly.</li>
					<li><strong>Van de Graaff Generator and Wimshurst Generator: </strong>Designed and constructed a Van de Graaff generator using an aluminum can, thread, Teflon Tape, and a rubber band. Also constructed a Wimshurst generator and Leiden jars using plastic CD casings and mason jars.</li>
					<li><strong>3D Printing: </strong>Designed and 3D printed many other parts including an adjustable laser alignment jig for aligning the optics on my CO2 Laser, clamps for a glass build plate for my 3D printer, a flashlight mount for my bicycle, various electronics enclosures, and a splint for myself after injuring my finger.</li>
