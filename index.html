				<!-- Coffee Pot -->

				<h3>Coffee Pot Designed for Users with Hand Tremors</h3>
				<div id="coffee-pot">
					<ul>
						<li>Collaborated with a team of 7 people to design a coffee pot that <br> is safe and ergonomic to use for a user with hand tremors</li>
						<li>Conducted brainstorming sessions and created three alternative <br> designs from which the final design was based upon</li>
						<li>Applied the Pahl and Beitz System of Design to ensure rank the <br> alternative designs</li>
						<li>Designed a hinge inspired by the ball joint of a boxer's speed <br> bag that would absorb the motion of involuntary hand movement</li>
						<li>Led the modeling of the final design and utlized Autodesk Fusion <br> 360 computer aided design software</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Additional Projects</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Rocketry: </strong>Constructed various rockets using many different types of fuels including hair spray, alcohol vapors, water and air pressure as well as conventional model rocket engines. The water rocket was about two feet tall and was made from several two liter soda bottles. The water rocket used a G-force sensor and arduino to detect its apogee and deploy a parachute.</li>
					<li><strong>Golf Putter Head: </strong>Designed and 3D printed a putter head that better fit my eye. The putter head was carefully designed with additional curves and a better alignment system.</li>
					<li><strong>Audio Driver: </strong>Designed a speaker driver that used ferrofluid as a lubricant to reduce vibrational noise due to friction as the speaker oscillated.</li>
					<li><strong>3-Stage Coil Gun: </strong>Built a three stage coil gun. Designed a gate sensor to fire each coil stage only when the projectile was a certain distance from the coil stage. This allowed for each coil stage to be fired in succession based on the position of the projectile in the barrel rather than a predetermined time delay. This increased the effectiveness of each stage. The coilgun used spools that were 3D printed to allow for easy wrapping of the magnet wire.</li>
					<li><strong>High Voltage Experiments: </strong>Built two high voltage power supplies using flyback transformers from old television sets. Then used the power supplies to power high voltage demos such as Jacob's ladder and ion-lifters. Was able to power the CO2 laser (from above) with one of them.</li>
					<li><strong>Aluminum Foundry: </strong>Contructed an aluminum foundry using play sand and a plaster of Paris refractory material. A heat gun forced hot air into the bottom of the foundry. The foundry was able to completely melt aluminum cans and heat steel until it was red hot and malleable.</li>
					<li><strong>Reaction Time Arcade Game: </strong>Designed and constructed a reaction time arcade game as part of a team. The game utilized a 3D printed infrared blaster device that was to be drawn and fired by the player in minimal time. The game was programmed using an Arduino microcontroller and included a game mode that allowed the player to duel against a computer simulated player that increased in difficulty. The longer the player lasted against the computer, the higher the player's score.</li>
					<li><strong>Van de Graaff Generator: </strong>Designed and constructed a Van de Graaff generator using an aluminum can. Also constructed a Wimshurst generator and Leiden jars using plastic CD casings and mason jars.</li>
					<li><strong>3D Printing: </strong>Designed and 3D printed many other parts including an adjustable laser alignment jig for aligning the optics on my CO2 Laser, clamps for a glass build plate for my 3D printer, a flashlight mount for my bicycle, various electronics enclosures, and a splint for myself after injuring my finger.</li>
